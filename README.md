# Crawly Project: Zone Queuer
This takes in a list of domains, processes through them, and queues an item for each in a form that the Crawly Server can understand.

This code is published so that others can see and use it as an example or starting point - it's not currently in a state where it can be run on it's own without tweaks and modifications. If you think you can improve this issue (such as by adding configurability) or otherwise help the project by submitting code, I welcome all contributions.
